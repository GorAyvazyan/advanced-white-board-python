# Advanced Digital Whiteboard Project

## Project Description
This project aims to create an **Advanced Digital Whiteboard** using Python. The whiteboard will allow users to draw freely, customize pen colors and widths, erase drawings, upload images to the canvas, and save their work as an image file. It can be used for presentations, sketches, or collaborative brainstorming sessions.

## Features
- **Freehand Drawing**: Draw freely on the canvas using different pen styles.
- **Customizable Pen**: Change pen color and width for more flexibility.
- **Eraser**: Use the eraser tool to remove specific parts of the drawing from the canvas.
- **Clear Canvas**: Reset the canvas with a single button click.
- **Save Drawing**: Save the current drawing as an image file (PNG format).
- **Image Upload**: Upload images onto the canvas for annotation or presentation purposes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for backend functionality.
- **Tkinter**: GUI library for creating the user interface.
- **Pillow**: Python Imaging Library (PIL) for handling canvas drawing and saving images.
